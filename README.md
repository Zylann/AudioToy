AudioToy (working title)
---------------------

I discovered wavepot.com some time ago, and decided to make my own version of it, and probably integrate custom features.
I wrote it from scratch, it's not a rip-off, as I also make it for HTML5/WebAudio learning.
The first new features I'm going to develop is stereo support, fader-style controls and the ability to save audio files.
